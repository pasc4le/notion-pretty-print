# Notion Pretty-Print
This is a simple tool to pretty-print your Notion notes with custom styles. I've taken some code from [Samuel Kraft's Guide](https://samuelkraft.com/blog/building-a-notion-blog-with-public-api).
## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo to your machine: `git clone https://github.com/pasc4le/notion-pretty-print.git`
2. Go to [Your Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations) and create a new integration. (This could be either an Internal or Public Integration)
3. Get the NOTION_DATABASE_ID you want to use for Notion Pretty Print. [Guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67728038/where-to-find-database-id-for-my-database-in-notion)
4. Create a `.env` file that contains your Integration Token and the Database ID.
```env
NOTION_TOKEN=your_token
NOTION_DATABASE_ID=your_database_id
```
5. Build the nextjs webapp with `yarn build`
6. Start the webapp with `yarn start`
